### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

### Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

R script called run_analysis.R  that did all the following.

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

(1)cp3test is the test data set,cp3train is the train data set.

(2)cp3q1Data is the target data set.



2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

(1)cp3q2mean is the vector of mean for each measurement.

(2)cp3q2sd is the vector of standard deviation for each measurement.

(3)cp3q2Data is the target data set,including the mean and standard deviation.


3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

(1)activity_labels is vector of activity names.

(2)cp3q3Data is the target data set which has exact activity tag.


4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

(1)features is the vector of the exact variable names.

(2)cp3q3Data is the target data set which has appropriately labels.



5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
